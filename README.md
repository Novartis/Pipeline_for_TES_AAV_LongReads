# Pipeline_for_TES_AAV_LongReads
This pipeline is designed for AAV integration site analysis using Target Enrichment Sequencing (TES) coupled with PacBio long-read sequencing. It enables the detection of integration site breakpoints and provides information on the structure of the integrated AAV vector genome to support the safety assessment of AAV-based gene therapies.
